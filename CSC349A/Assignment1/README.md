1. Create a working copy of **Euler Function** using MATLAB. Solve given differential equations using it and compute the relative errors of them  in the compound approximation

2. Modify the **Euler Function** in MATLAB to solve the falling parachutist problem, compute the numerical approximation and relative error of the problem in given condition
