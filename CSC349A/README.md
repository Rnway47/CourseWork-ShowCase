# Course Overview
To introduce students to the concepts of roundoff error, truncation error, numerical stability and condition, Taylor polynomial approximations; to derive and apply some fundamental algorithms for solving scientific and engineering problems: roots of nonlinear equations, systems of linear equations, polynomial and spline interpolation, numerical differentiation and integration, numerical solutions of ordinary differential equations.



# Learning Outcomes
Numerical Analysis is the study of algorithms for solving problems of continuous mathematics. This course provides an introduction to several fundamental algorithms for solving **scientific and engineering problems**, along with their **derivation** and **application**. Students will learn how to apply these algorithms, and how to use them in **MATLAB**.
