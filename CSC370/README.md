# Course Overview
This course provides an overview of a relational database management system (RDBMS), from modelling the world and designing a database to querying the data and optimising performance in a manner that maintains the critical ACID properties of a database. 
The course will include elements of software engineering, theoretical computer science, programming in the SQL language, and computer systems.

# Learning Outcomes
* Database Design: how can we describe the world in terms of data?
* Data Analysis: how can we answer questions about the world in terms of questions on such data?
* Concurrency and Robustness: how does the database management system (DBMS) allow multiple users to query and modify the same data? What happens when there is a system failure?
* Efficiency and Scalability: how does the DBMS store large amounts of data and process them efficiently?
