# Operations Research: Simulation - Course Objectives

The course objectives are to study in depth on how to perform system simulations. 

The course discusses in detail about
-   system modeling concepts
-   applying statistical modeling techniques
-   performance study of elementary queuing systems 
-   simulation data analysis

After the course, the students will be able to
-   build abstract models of systems
-   develop and run the discrete-event system simulation models using general and special purpose programming tools
-   understand and program statistical models in simulation
-   analyze simulation data using various statistical techniques
